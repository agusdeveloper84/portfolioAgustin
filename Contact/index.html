                <h3>Front-End <br>Web Developer</h3>
                <p class="about-me">Since I was a child I have been experimenting with design and trying to create websites. I remember playing around with
                Adobe Dreamweaver in the 90's and being fascinated with this.<p/>
                <p class="about-me">
                Growing up I discovered that this was my passion and that I wanted this for my life. I found this career not only to be
                my passion but also a hobby, that is why I spend my free time creating and coding, enjoying every minute working on it,
                to improve myself day by day.</p>
                <p class="about-me">
                Through the years I have been studying at Colleges, Boot Camps and online courses to improve my knowledge and become
                better than never. I am really passionate about this career, good at problem solving, love to create and help. Enjoying
                everyday coding is my key to success.</p>
                <p class="about-me">
                I believe that the skills I have gained as a Front-End Web Developer in the past year will contribute to this growing
                industry. I have a strong desire to work in a team that will help create optimized and creative websites that showcase
                amazing brands and products. I believe that this career is a key to help people to build and make their ideas come true.</p>
